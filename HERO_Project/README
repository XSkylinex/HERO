name convention:
Methods start with lower case and then upper case for each word: useThis()
Variables are all lower case and use '_' : this_var

The general configuration data is saved in a local file and imported (or read) when HERO starts running.
Think hard before hard-coding anything - should this be in the configuration file?
                                         Would anybody want to change that ever?
